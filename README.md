# SFTwitterWatch

### Dependencies:
  pip install python-twitter

## Hack Short Description
SF Twitter Watch was created to improve the relationship between our customers and State Farm. Public Relations Representatives constantly work to improve this relationship, leading us to create a tool that would better facilitate engagement between community and company

## Hack Description (please include tools/tech you used)
As a tool that PR representatives might be using on a daily basis, we decided to create a web application thanks to its ease of access and flexibility. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop the user interface, and Flask (a python microframework) to handle the backend.
