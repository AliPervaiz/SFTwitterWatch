## Hack Short Description
A web application that facilitates communication between company and critics, allowing State Farm to address complaints and quicken response time.

## Hack Description (please include tools/tech you used)
State Farm has always put its customers first. We created SF Twitter Watch, a PR tool that facilitates communication between company and a disatisfied community, to uphold the very same value. SF Twitter Watch allows easy response to customers on twitter by PR, emphasizing customer relations

As a tool that PR representatives might be using on a daily basis, we decided to create a web application thanks to its ease of access and flexibility. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop the user interface, and Flask (a python microframework) to handle the backend.
