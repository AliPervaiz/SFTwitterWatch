## Hack Short Description
A web app that facilitates communication between company and critics, allowing State Farm to address complaints and improve response time.

## Hack Description (please include tools/tech you used)
State Farm has always put its customers first, which was why we created SF Twitter Watch, a PR tool to uphold the very same value. SF Twitter Watch allows for quick responses to unhappy customers on twitter, helping to bolster State Farm's public image and strengthen our connection with our customers.

As a tool that PR representatives might be using on a daily basis, we decided to create a web application thanks to its ease of access and flexibility. We programmed our user interface using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the backend of our app used Flask (a python microframework) to handle HTTP requests. To retrieve the negative tweets from twitter, we used the Twitter API and its advanced search function. Additionally, we used IBM Watson's natural language processing api to analyze State Farm's responses in order to quantify SF's positive impact on the public.
